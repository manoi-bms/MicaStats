# kil0bit System Monitor — User Guide (v3.0.0)

A complete guide to using, customizing, and mastering your hardware telemetry overlay.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Installation
The app is provided as a unified installer:
- **`Kil0bitSystemMonitor-Setup.exe`**: A high-performance setup that handles your Start Menu, Desktop shortcuts, and ensures the app is registered correctly for startup.

Download the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kil0bit-kb/kil0bit-system-monitor/releases) and launch.

## 🖥️ The Overlay

The overlay is a slim, elegant pill that sits directly on your **Windows 11 taskbar**. It displays real-time telemetry from your hardware:

### 📈 Included Metrics
- **CPU**: Total processor load percentage.
- **RAM**: Real-time memory pressure.
- **NET**: Combined Upload and Download speeds.
- **GPU**: Raw load and temperatures from your graphics processor.
- **DISK**: Real-time activity and storage usage for multiple drives simultaneously.

### 📉 Live Graphs
Turn on **Live Graphs** in **Appearance** to draw a small bar chart of recent history beside each
reading, so you can see a trend rather than just an instant value. Graphs work in both Standard and
Compact label modes, and a sensor that cannot be read shows a flat baseline rather than a
misleading zero.

## 📊 The Stats Panel

**Click the overlay** to open the stats panel — a dropdown with the detail the taskbar has no room
for:

- **History graphs** for processor, memory, graphics, network and storage.
- **Per-logical-processor load**, one bar per thread.
- **Top processes** by CPU, with their memory use.
- **System summary**: processor model, graphics adapter, total memory, Windows build and uptime.

Press **Esc** or click anywhere else to dismiss it. Process sampling only runs while the panel is
open, so a closed panel costs nothing.

If you would rather clicking never opened the panel, turn off **Panel on Click** in **Appearance**;
the panel stays available from the right-click menu as **Show Stats Panel**.

---

### 🖱️ Overlay Controls
- **Click**: Opens the stats panel.
- **Drag & Move**: Press and drag the overlay to reposition it. A click that does not move opens
  the panel instead, so both gestures share the same button. *(Dragging requires **Lock Position**
  OFF.)*
- **Snap to Taskbar**: When enabled, the overlay snaps to the taskbar area. Disable this to **free-float** the overlay anywhere on your screen.
- **Toggle Lock**: Right-click the overlay and select **Lock Position** to prevent any accidental movement.
- **Settings**: Right-click to quickly jump into the dashboard.

## 🏠 Home Dashboard

The Home dashboard is your high-level control center. It features four primary quick-links:
1. **General**: Configure startup behavior and app lifecycle.
2. **Monitoring**: Select which hardware sensors to track.
3. **Appearance**: Customize font, colors, and styling.
4. **About**: View version history and developer links.

## ⚙️ Core Configuration

Open the **Settings Window** to customize your experience:

### 🚀 General Settings
- **Hardware Overlay**: Toggle the entire overlay on or off.
- **Snap to Taskbar**: Enable to snap to the taskbar; disable to **unlock** it so you can position the overlay anywhere on your desktop.
- **Launch on Startup**: Enable this to start monitoring automatically when you log in to Windows.
- **Lock Position**: Lock the overlay in its current location.
- **Hide in Full Screen**: Automatically hides the overlay when a full-screen application or game is active to prevent distractions.
- **Keep on Top**: Forces the overlay to stay above all other windows.
- **Refresh Rate**: Customize how often the sensors update (from 500ms for high precision to 5s for ultra-low overhead).

### 📊 Monitoring & Sensors
- **Sensor Selection**: Choose which metrics you want to see (CPU, RAM, NET, GPU, DISK).
- **Network Adapter**: If you have multiple network cards (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, VPN), pick the one you want to track.
- **Multi-Disk Selection**: In v3.0, you can select multiple drives simultaneously. The overlay will dynamically adjust to show activity (C:DK, D:DK, etc.) for each drive you select. Pick up to 9 drives for a balanced 3x3 layout.

### 🎨 Appearance & Design
- **Accent Color**: Pick a color that matches your Windows theme.
- **Font Selection**: Choose from high-legibility fonts (Segoe UI, Outfit, Inter).
- **Design Mode**: Toggle between **Standard** and **Compact** modes for different levels of detail.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: The overlay is missing!**  
A: Go to **Monitoring** settings and ensure at least one sensor is toggled **ON**.

**Q: Why doesn't the app start with Windows?**  
A: Ensure "Launch on Windows Startup" is enabled in **General** settings. This registers the app in your user registry for a seamless boot experience.

**Q: Windows says "Unknown Publisher" or "SmartScreen" prevents it from running.**  
A: This happens because the app is a local, independent release. Click **"More Info"** and then **"Run Anyway"**. v3.0 is a lightweight, zero-bloat build with no telemetry or external tracking.

**Q: My network speed shows 0 KB/s.**  
A: In **Monitoring** settings, select the correct active Network Adapter from the dropdown menu.
